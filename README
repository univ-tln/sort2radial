This software called SORT2RADIAL is a computer program whose purpose is to 
derive radial current velocities from input SORT or USORT Wera radar 
data using a matched direction finding algorithm.
 
It is a fortran version of the Matlab code developped by 
"Laboratoire de Sondages Electromagn√©tiques de l'Environnement Terrestre, UMR 6017" 
now integrated into the MIO (Mediterranean Institute of Oceanography).

#How to compile
###############

- You will need a fortran compiler, for instance intel ifort,  or gfortran
- Current makefile is configured for use with gfortran
- You will need a c compiler
- Current makefile is configured, for instance  intel icc,  or gcc
- Current makefile is configured for use with gcc
- Run the Makefile :

make

###############
#How to execute
###############

- bin/main.exe reads parameters in standard input and take as arguments:
  1 : path of output file
  2 to N : several paths of SORT or USORT files.
- Typical execution commande is the following:

cat <param_file> | ./bin/main.exe <output_file.asc> <file_USORT1> <file_USORT2> ... <file_USORTN>

- Input parameters and their meaning are described in the example:
etc/params.txt

- Example of output ascii file

- Run the test :

make test

-> This produce the output ascii file example/2014104000000.rad
   which should be the same than example/2014104000000_ref.rad.
